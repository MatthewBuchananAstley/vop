The voice of pinocchio (or pinocchia if you want)

"password generator"

You can now have "The voice of pinocchio or pinocchia" on your computer!
What would the sweet voice of pinoccio or pinocchia provide?

Reasonably secure passwords!

With shorter passwords the uppercase or lowercase letters are sometimes missing so they should be added manually.
I have to program that, however passwords should be longer anyway.
Also only after programming a great deal of this tool I noticed there is another module (secrets) that provides the same functionality, so different wheel. However i should look into that more if it uses the more secure urandom.

Adding some manual additional characters increases the password security even farther.

usage:

./otp_m.py 32 (64 characters max)
